RadDock is a program I made while working as a computer repair technician for a company that specializes in point-of-sale computers. My original idea was to make it easy for users to find common functions that they might use once a day, but not all the time. This way they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to minimize whatever they were working on to find their application. The idea was mainly inspired by browser bookmarks, but for everything instead of just websites.</description></item><item><title>colonelpopcorn/generator-osticket</title><link>https://colonelpopcorn.github.io/posts/generator-osticket/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://colonelpopcorn.github.io/posts/generator-osticket/</guid><description>I used to work on an osticket installation at a computer repair depot. We used it to keep track of engineering work to support the depot. Unfortuneately, we modified a copy of the osTicket source code instead of using the plugin system. While this arrangement gave us incredible control over the software, it made upgrading an install pretty difficult.
I tried to begin the process of moving our code over to a plugin system, but found the lack of boilerplate/documentation hard to live with.</description></item></channel></rss>
