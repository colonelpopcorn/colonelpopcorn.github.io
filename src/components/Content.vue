	<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio page! Below you'll find various open-source projects and components from <a href="https://freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a> excercises. I'm a software developer, currently working for NCR with a specialization in bringing together hardware testing tools and front-end test orchestration. I primarily work in C#, but I also have experience in PHP, Javascript, Python, and C++ for Windows. I am very interested in learning more about computers and the various open-source tools available to me.</p>

    Some of the open source tools that I enjoy working with are:

    <ul>
      <li>Docker</li>
      <li>Jenkins</li>
      <li>Proxmox</li>
      <li>Mattermost</li>
      <li>Gitlab</li>
      <li>Unity</li>
    </ul>

    I also enjoy trying out different web frameworks. Some of my favorite web frameworks include:

    <ul>
      <li>Laravel</li>
      <li>ASP.NET Core</li>
      <li>Phoenix</li>
